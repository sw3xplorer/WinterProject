        Console.WriteLine("Greetings. I assume you have been told about what happened last night. We need your expertise in slaying some creatures.");
        Console.WriteLine("We can't allow our village to keep being attacked. Let's get you ready.");
        Console.WriteLine("The chief gives you some equipment. A sword, some food and potions.");
        // You gained said items. Write code for this.
        Console.WriteLine("These provisions should be enough to get you started. We will pay you for your efforts.");
        Console.WriteLine("You may spend your rewards at our armory for better equipment.");
        Console.WriteLine("For your first comission, we have had reports of goblins outside our village, around where the lumberjacks work.");
        Console.WriteLine("Go and make sure that area is safe. Off you go now.");
        Console.WriteLine("You head out of the guild and towards the woods.");
